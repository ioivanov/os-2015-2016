# Third meeting

## Basic commands and `bash` concepts #2

### Exercises

Using the commands learned so far, write a `bash` command line to:

1. Output the processor model name from the `/proc/cpuinfo` file.
2. Output the amount of free memory from the `/proc/meminfo` file.
3. Output all names of groups in which the `daemon` user participates
   (group info is stored in `/etc/group`).
4. Output the pseudo-terminal names (the `TTY` column) for each `bash` instance
   (use the output of the `ps ax` command line invocation).
