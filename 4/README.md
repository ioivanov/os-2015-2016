# Fourth meeting

## Exercises

### `find` command

1. Copy all (regular) files in the `/bin` directory which begin with `mk` to
   the `/tmp/$USER` directory.
2. Write all lines in all `*.conf` files in the `/etc` directory which begin
   with a `[` character to the `/tmp/$USER/headers` file.
   (The regex syntax for matching something in the beginning is `^`.)
3. Write all lines in all `*.conf` files in the `/etc` directory which contain
   a `=` character to a `/tmp/$USER/NAME` file
   (where *NAME* is the base filename, i.e. the filename without the directory).
4. Create an `etc` directory in `/tmp/$USER` and move the `*.conf` files which
   we created in step 3. to that directory.

### `diff` command
